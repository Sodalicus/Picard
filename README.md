Purpose of the my little project is learning: 
- python/flask, 
- html/css/js, 
- sql
- bash
- git
- digital electronics basics.

Project is about RapberryPi used as radio player, controlled by webUI in LAN, or IR remote.
RPi is connected and is communicating by serial with the ArduinoNano, 
which in turn is connected to the sensors or other peripheral devices,
acting as driver and/or 3.3V/5V bridge.
